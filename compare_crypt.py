# neanderthal brute force hash comparison v.0.0.5
#
# some very old password databases using DES crypt(3) hashes will truncate the stored string from 13 chars down to 10 chars, including a 2 byte salt at the beginning
# e.g.
# properly formatted with be:
# crypt.crypt("MyDumbPassword","My")'
# MyKy9iPtz5SPM ==  13bytes. 11 bytes + 2 byte salt
# so, what would be stored in this logic is a truncated 10 byte string -  MyKy9iPtz5, 8 bytes + 2 byte salt (My)
# 
# this breaks the input scrubbing logic for tools like john the ripper or hashcat which are expecting the correct 13byte length
# which will lead to the infamous
# "No password hashes loaded (see FAQ)" or "Token length exception" errors
# hashcat --identify will guess these as type 16000 and flail
# This is a pain because you lose the power of default string mangling rules. 
#
# In this case my sloppy workaround is to take pubicly available pre-mangled stringfiles, chop them down to 8 chars max, then split the multi-GB file
# into smaller chunks to not overload local memory. this was faster than rewriting a good mangler.
# ProTip: as modern testers we get used to baseline minumum lengths and complexity requirements - this was not a baseline with much older systems
# When generating precompiled lists you will also want to run the permutations of alphanumerics from 1-7 characters and add them to your inputs.
# in the test I ran:
# More than 60% of the accounts utilized a single character, 15% unmodified dictionary words, 5% well known passwords, and 5% number permutations. 
# The rest remain - as of now - uncracked.
# 
# splitting large password inputs into smaller chunks then iterating through them to compare hashes against the local hash
# need to install legacycrypt - crypt(3) no longer supported in python3 crypt libraries
# TODO
# - loop breaks when user discovered !!!!
# - automate importing userdb/add command line switch
# - add userdb import from a JSON file or a CSV file
